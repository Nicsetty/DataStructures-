# Graph Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of classic graph algorithms in C, specifically the **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a directed graph. The algorithms are designed to work with a user-defined graph structure represented by an adjacency matrix.

## Projects Included

### 1. Tower of Hanoi
- **Description**: A C program that simulates the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, allowing users to move disks between rods while following the puzzle's rules.
- **Input**: Number of disks (user-defined).
- **Output**: Moves required to solve the puzzle.

### 2. 4-Queens Problem
- **Description**: A C program that solves the 4-Queens problem by placing four queens on a 4x4 chessboard without them attacking each other.
- **Input**: N/A (the board size is fixed to 4).
- **Output**: Positions of the queens on the board.

### 3. Airport Runway Simulation
- **Description**: A C program that simulates the operation of an airport runway, managing queues for landing and takeoff operations.
- **Input**: Number of landing and takeoff planes.
- **Output**: Events at each time unit (landing, takeoff, or idle).

### 4. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Description**: A C program that implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph with non-negative weights.
- **Input**: Number of vertices and the adjacency matrix representing the graph.
- **Output**: Shortest path cost and the sequence of nodes in the shortest path from source to destination.

## How to Run the Programs
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/nicsetty/DataStructures- 
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd DataStructures-
3. Compile the desired C program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)

## Dependencies
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of C programming and data structures
